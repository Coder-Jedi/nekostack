# NekoStack Progress Tracker

## Guidelines for Updates
- Keep entries simple and concise
- Only document completed work, not future plans
- Reference the source file/document that guided the implementation
- Use format: `[Date] - [What was done] - [Source file reference]`
- Focus on actual implementation progress, not planning or documentation
